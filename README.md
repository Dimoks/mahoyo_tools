# mahoyo-tools
extract and reinject files into Witch of the Holy Night (Steam)


Requires python >= 3.10, `numpy`, `Pillow`, `zlib`.
`imagequant` is necessary on some ciconstances to quantize some images before
injection.

## Open `.hfa` Archive

`.hfa` archive files contents are accessed through `HfaArchive` objects.

```python
import os
from mahoyo_tools import hfa
GAME_DIR = "path/to/steamapps/common/WITCH ON THE HOLY NIGHT"
hfa_name = "data00000"
hfa_path = os.path.join(game_dir, f"{hfa_name}.hfa")

archive = hfa.HfaArchive(hfa_path)
```

An optional `mode` parameter can be set to `'rw'` in the `HfaArchive`
constructor to automatically replace the original file content when the archive
is closed. Otherwise, the original file will stay untouched unless specifically
written to.

```python
archive = hfa.HfaArchive(hfa_path, 'rw')
```

To access the content, open the archive using either the `open()` method or
the `with` syntax.
Once all accesses to the archive content is complete, use the `close()` method
to close the file or exit the `with` block.
If the `mode` parameter in the constructor was set to `'rw'`, then the original
file content is replaced when closing the file.

## Access archive entries

An opened archive maps entry names or indices to `HfaArchiveEntry` objects
that hold entry info and are used to access entry data.

```python
entry = archive[entry_name]
# or
entry = archive[index]
```
Enties can be used as files to access the entry data, through one of the
following methods :
  - `read()`, `write()`, `seek()` and `tell()` that reproduce the behaviour of
    python's `io.BufferedRandom` objects;
  - `data` property to get and set all the data bytes of the entry;
  - `to_file()` and `from_file()` to load in / from a file all the entry data
    bytes;
  - `extract()` and `inject()` that decompress the content of the entry to a
    file, or compress the content of the file to the entry bytes (c.f. below).

## Extract / Inject content to an entry

Contents of an archive entry can be extracte or injected using the `extract()`
and `inject()` methods.

When possible, the `extract()` method decompresses the content of the archive
entry to the destination file passed in parameter.
The `inject()` method compresses the content of a file back to the archive
entry.

Some limitations apply, depending on the file format :
 - `mzp` images may require the `imagequant` python package to reduce the
    palette sizeto 256 colors before injection;
 - `ctd` scripts are decompressed, but are reinjected as-is, as the
    _LenZuCompressor_ compression algorithm has not yet been efficiently
    re-written (this should not impact the game);
 - `ccit` font files are not transformed to an other format. use the `Font`
    class (described below) to modify the font files;
 - `chs` files cannot be decompiled yet, and are therefore extracted and
    re-injected as-is;

## MZP Image compression

MZP images can be injected with no compression (resulting in a fast injection
but a very high file size), or with higher compression. Specify the parameter
`compression_level = 0 | 1 | 2` in the `inject` method to set the compression
level to 0 (literal, no compression), 1 (literal + RLE) or 2 (literal + RLE +
BACKREF). Default value is 0 (no compression)

## Modifying the fonts

The fonts in the game are separated in multiple files and formats :
 - `mzp` images where the characters are drawn
 - `ccit` files that list all the characters, their position in the images and
 their dimensions

`mzp` font images can be generated properly using the `font.svg` file included
in the repository. A guide to generate the images using **Inkscape** is included in
it.
Once the images are generated, inject them in the game files using the script:
```python
from os import path
from mahoyo_tools import hfa
from PIL import Image

game_dir = "path/to/steamapps/common/WITCH ON THE HOLY NIGHT"
input_dir = "path/to/png/files"
font_images = [
    "FONT_en_H00", # page 1 of standard characters
    "FONT_en_H01", # page 2 of standard characters
    "FONT_en_font3_00", # font used in nz (special) chapters
    "FONT_en_italic_00" # italic characters used in the game
]
# open the fonts archive
with hfa.HfaArchive(path.join(game_dir, "data00100.hfa"), 'rw') as hfa :
    # iterate over font file names
    for file_name in font_images :
        # replace the image in the archive
        png_path = path.join(input_dir, f"{file_name}.png")
        hfa[f"{file_name}.mzp"].inject(png_path, compression_level = 2)
```

`ccit` files can be generated using the `ccit.Font` class and injected in the
game files using the script:
```python
# { character: width }
# max width is 73
font = Font({
    ' ':26, '!':21, '"':27, '#':45, '$':45, '%':65, '&':52, "'":17, '(':27, ')':27, '*':33, '+':45, ',':21, '-':31,

})

with HfaArchive(f"{path_to_game}/data00100.hfa", 'rw') as archive :
    archive["Font010000.ccit"].inject(font.to_ccit())
```
Repeat this script for Font010100.ccit (italic font) and Font010200.ccit
(nz font)

If you have empty slots between characters in the font image, you must fill the
empty slots of the ccit file with unused characters (here ❶, ❷, ..., ⓯)
